# KNN-Algorithm-from-Scratch
Building the KNN algorithm with out importing the Sklearn module
<br>
Above is a very simple implementation of a K-nearest Neighbor classifier
This is a very slow and inefficient implementation, and in real-world problems, it is always recommended to use established libraries (like scikit-learn) instead of implementing algorithms from scratch.
The scikit-learn library, for example, implements kNN much more efficiently and robustly -- using advanced data structures (KD-Tree and Ball-Tree)
A scenario where it is useful to implement algorithms from scratch is for learning purpose.
